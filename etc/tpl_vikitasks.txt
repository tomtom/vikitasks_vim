*vikitasks.txt*     Search viki files for tasks and display them in a list
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

NOTE: This plugin is not actively maintained any more. I now think it was a 
mistake to mix text & todo/priority lists this way. My preferred solution for 
such lists now is https://github.com/tomtom/ttodo_vim/ and other 
todo.txt-related apps.

This plugin provides a quick overview of priority/task lists maintained 
in different viki files. Depending on your settings, you can quickly 
search all "homepages" of intervikis or search only project-specific 
files.


Usage:
    :VikiTasks[!] [CONSTRAINT] [PATTERN] [FILE_PATTERNS]


Features:
    - Collect tasks from viki's priority lists (see |viki-tasks|)
    - Sort those tasks
    - Browse tasks with a given date
    - Optionally browse all tasks (incl. those without a date)

Tutorial: How does it work?~

Let's say you have the files:

foo.txt: >
    * Foo
        #A 2009-12-13 Do this
        #C 2009-12-20 Call @Anna
        #A Whatever

bar.txt: >
    * Bar
        #C 2009-12-24 Wish @Bernie good luck
        #D 2009-11-01 Do that

Let's assume you have added both files to |g:vikitasks#files|. Switch to 
the buffer foo.txt and call >

    :VikiTasks

and you get the following list: >

    Bar.txt|2| #D 2009-11-01 Do that
    Foo.txt|2| #A 2009-12-13 Do this
    Foo.txt|3| #C 2009-12-20 Call @Anna
    Bar.txt|3| #C 2009-12-24 Wish @Bernie good luck

If you do/had done this on the 15 December 2009, the third line would be 
highlighted, i.e. the entries above the cursor refer to passed/missed 
events. If you had called :VikiTasks! (behold the bang), then the 
"Whatever" entry would have been included in the list too.

If you had called >
    
    :VikiTasks current

only the first two items would be listed.

This week's tasks (i.e. the tasks that should be accomplished today or 
within the following six days) can be listed with >
    
    :VikiTasks 6
